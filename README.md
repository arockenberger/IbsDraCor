# IbsDraCor

## Content

IbsDraCor is a corpus of plays by [Henrik Ibsen](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henrik_Ibsen). The corpus is complete in 
as far as it contains all plays written by Ibsen in their first printed edition. The corpus does not include unpublished plays.

The plays are in XML-TEI P5. They were downloaded from the official website of the Henrik-Ibsen digital scholarly edition, 
[Henrik Ibsen skrifter](https://www.ibsen.uio.no/forside.xhtml) in December 2018 while the website was running on version 1.3.
The website has been developed by and is hosted by the Univesity of Oslo, Henrik Ibsen skrifter and the Unit for Digital Documentation.

Henrik Ibsen skrifter allows downloading, using, sharing, and changing the XML-files in its collection. Every XML-file contains 
information about the creator(s) of the file, copyright etc. in the TEI header.

Annika Rockenberger (@arockenberger) has created this repository for integration into the [DraCor](https://dracor.org/) Drama Corpus.
